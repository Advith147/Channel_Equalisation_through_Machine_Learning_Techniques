# Channel_Equalisation_through_Machine_Learning_Techniques
## 1. Introduction
Welcome to our machine learning-based equalization channel! In this series, we will delve into the interesting area of channel equalization and see how linear regression may be used to improve it. In communication systems, channel equalization is essential for reducing the negative consequences of channel distortion. We can create sophisticated algorithms to estimate and correct for channel impairments by utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression. Join us as we explore the foundations, applications, and real-world applications of channel equalization, revealing how machine learning has the power to completely transform this essential component of contemporary communication.
## 2. Methodology
To produce the intended result, the project used a methodical approach. The following were the major steps in the process:
## 2.1 Data Collection
It is essential to locate and eliminate outliers or abnormalities from the dataset in order to guarantee the model performs at its best. The behavior of the model may be adversely affected by these erratic data points' introduction of discrepancies. It is easy to identify any odd patterns or values by carefully inspecting the historical sales data, taking into account information such as the date, product information, sales amount, and any pertinent factors. By removing these outliers, the dataset's integrity can be preserved, the model can be trained on more accurate and representative data, and it will be better equipped to forecast future sales trends.
## 2.2 Data Preprocessing
For the purpose of converting the acquired dataset's raw data into an analysis-ready format, multiple preprocessing processes were taken. Incorrect or inconsistent entries, duplicate records, and outliers were all addressed using data cleaning procedures. The application of normalization and feature scaling ensured that the scales of the various variables were comparable, preventing biases in the analysis. Incomplete instances were removed in place of missing values, or imputation techniques like mean or median substitution were used. By carrying out these preprocessing procedures, the dataset was prepared in a consistent and standardized manner, making it more susceptible to various analysis and modeling tools, ultimately enhancing the quality of insights and forecasts.
## 2.3 Feature Selection 
For the purpose of converting the acquired dataset's raw data into an analysis-ready format, multiple preprocessing processes were taken. Techniques for feature selection have been used to improve the model's performance and simplify it. The goal of these methods was to extract and save the dataset's most useful and pertinent attributes. Each feature's contribution to the predictive power of the model was evaluated using a variety of techniques, including correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, and feature importance ratings. An output graph, which graphically depicts the significance or relevance of each attribute, was generated to aid analysis and decision-making. The selection process was aided by this graph's simpler identification of significant elements, which made it possible to create a model that was more streamlined, efficient, and performed better.
## 2.4 Model Development 
Linear regression, a widely used algorithm for predictive modeling, was selected as the primary algorithm. The training dataset was divided into a feature matrix (X) and a target vector (y). The linear regression model was then fitted to the training data using an appropriate library or programming framework. 
## 2.5 Model Evaluation 
The generated model's performance was evaluated using a variety of evaluation measures, which offer information about how well the linear regression model and the MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) equalization procedure perform on the given dataset. The MSE values represent the average squared deviation between the expected and observed channel responses, with lower values indicating better performance. The R-squared values quantify the percentage of the channel response variance that the received signal can explain, with larger values suggesting a better fit.
